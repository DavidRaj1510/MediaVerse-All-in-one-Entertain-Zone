## 🔐 Authentication

- Email/Password Sign Up & Sign In  
- Google OAuth via Supabase  
- Session persistence with Supabase Auth helpers  
- Auth state listener redirects automatically to homepage after login

---

## 🧠 OpenAI API Integration

Uses OpenAI's GPT API to:

- Summarize novels, episodes, or volumes
- Generate title descriptions
- Recommend similar content based on user interest

> You'll need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file or in your Supabase function backend, if applicable.

---

## 🧭 Routing

- Uses **`HashRouter`** so navigation works correctly even on GitHub Pages
- Sample routes:
  - `/comics/:id`
  - `/anime/:id`
  - `/profile` (for authenticated users)
  - `/auth` (Login & Register)
